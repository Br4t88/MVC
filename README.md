# Spring MVC
Application is an example of a web shop connected to a database. 
It has the possibility to enter, change and delete customers and products from the shop.
<hr>
This is my biggest project.
For the first time I worked with multiple models and controllers, the biggest challenge I had but also the one from which I learned the most.
It is made in Tomcat server. 
After creating configuration files, controllers and models, the jsp page was created. 
The hardest part for me was when I connected a large number of forms with controllers.
But it was also a good lesson to learn.
